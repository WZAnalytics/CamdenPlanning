Camden Planning Applications Analysis

This project is the starting work for an analysis of Camden planning applications, focusing on environmentally-friendly (“green”) applications. The notebook cleans the data, normalising ward names using census postcode data. It uses vector embedding to determine which applications consider the environment, and charts and tables to visualise the outputs.

This is only preliminary work, the end-point I wanted the project to move towards was to determine whether green applications get passed more often, and subsequently an assessment of whether the success relates to the greenness of an application. 

Files included:

Camden Planning Applications_full.html - html export. Most of the vizzes wouldn't render
Camden Planning Applications.ipynb – main notebook
requirements.txt – dependencies

Key libraries: pandas, plotly, matplotlib, sentence-transformers, torch.

The notebook is ready to run start-to-finish.
